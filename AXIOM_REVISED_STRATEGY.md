# Axiom Revised Strategy

*After Critical Analysis: What Actually Makes Sense*

## The Pivot: From Everything to Something

### Original Vision (Too Broad)
- Complete QuantLib replacement
- All strategies for all traders
- Guardian Protocol AI
- Excel + Cloud + API + Everything

### Revised Focus (Realistic)
**Axiom = Automatic Differentiation for Finance, Nothing More**

## Why This Makes Sense

### 1. It Solves ONE Real Problem
```javascript
// Current state: Manual sensitivity calculations
function calculateDV01(swap, curve) {
    const baseNPV = swap.price(curve);
    const bumpedCurve = curve.bump(0.0001);
    const bumpedNPV = swap.price(bumpedCurve);
    return (bumpedNPV - baseNPV) / 0.0001;
}
// Repeat for EVERY quote, EVERY instrument

// With Axiom:
const npv = swap.price(curve); // Automatic
const dv01 = npv.derivatives;  // Already calculated!
```

### 2. Performance Can Be Acceptable
- Not trying to replace QuantLib's pricing
- Just adding AD layer on top
- User chooses when to use it
- Can fall back to finite differences

### 3. Clear Monetization Path
- Open source core library
- Paid enterprise support
- Training and certification
- Custom implementations

## The Realistic Product: Axiom.js

### Core Features Only
```javascript
// 1. Dual number implementation
import { Dual } from '@axiom/core';

// 2. Financial math with AD
import { pv, fv, irr, duration } from '@axiom/finance';

// 3. Integration helpers
import { withQuantLib, withRateslib } from '@axiom/adapters';

// That's it. No strategies, no Guardian, no Excel.
```

### What It Does Well
```javascript
// Example: Bond pricing with full sensitivities
function priceBond(cashflows, curve) {
    let price = new Dual(0);
    
    for (const cf of cashflows) {
        const df = curve.df(cf.date); // Returns Dual
        price = price.add(cf.amount.multiply(df));
    }
    
    return price; // Value + all sensitivities
}

// One calculation gives you:
// - Price
// - DV01 for each curve point
// - Cross-gammas
// - Any other derivatives you need
```

### Integration, Not Replacement
```javascript
// Works WITH existing libraries
const ql = await import('quantlib-wasm');
const axiom = await import('@axiom/core');

// Wrap existing functions
const enhancedCurve = axiom.enhance(ql.YieldCurve, {
    trackDerivatives: true
});

// Use normally, get derivatives free
const result = enhancedCurve.forwardRate(date1, date2);
console.log(result.value);       // The rate
console.log(result.derivatives); // All sensitivities
```

## Marketing Strategy

### Target Audience (Narrow)
- Quant developers at hedge funds
- Risk system developers
- Trading desk technologists
- FinTech startups

### Key Messages
1. "Automatic differentiation made simple"
2. "Stop calculating sensitivities manually"
3. "Works with your existing code"
4. "Open source, enterprise ready"

### Launch Strategy
1. **Blog post**: "Why I Built Axiom After Losing $6M"
2. **Hacker News**: Technical deep dive
3. **QuantNet**: Academic paper style
4. **LinkedIn**: Connect with network
5. **Conference talk**: QuantMinds or similar

## Success Metrics (Realistic)

### Year 1
- 1,000 GitHub stars
- 10,000 npm downloads/month
- 5 enterprise customers
- $125k revenue

### Year 2
- 5,000 GitHub stars
- 50,000 npm downloads/month
- 20 enterprise customers
- $500k revenue

### Year 3
- Sustainable business
- 2-3 employees
- Recognized AD solution
- Acquisition target?

## What We're NOT Building

1. **NOT a trading system**
2. **NOT a QuantLib replacement**
3. **NOT an AI guardian**
4. **NOT a strategy platform**
5. **NOT trying to do everything**

## Technical Decisions

### Language: TypeScript
- Type safety
- Good performance
- Wide adoption
- Easy distribution

### No Dependencies
- Zero runtime dependencies
- Small bundle size
- No version conflicts
- Maximum compatibility

### API Design
```typescript
// Simple, intuitive, chainable
const result = Dual.variable(100, 'notional')
    .multiply(Dual.variable(0.05, 'rate'))
    .multiply(Dual.variable(0.25, 'time'))
    .add(Dual.constant(100));

// Clean access to results
console.log(result.value);        // 101.25
console.log(result.wrt('rate'));  // 25 (derivative w.r.t. rate)
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Performance**: Provide escape hatches
- **Memory**: Implement derivative pruning
- **Accuracy**: Extensive test suite
- **Compatibility**: Multiple adapters

### Business Risks
- **Single founder**: Document everything
- **Competition**: Focus on simplicity
- **Adoption**: Start with Peter's network
- **Support burden**: Clear boundaries

## The Guardian Protocol (Transformed)

Instead of AI blocking trades, simple risk metrics:

```javascript
// Not AI, just math
function calculateStressScore(position, market) {
    const metrics = {
        sizeVsAverage: position.dv01 / averageDV01,
        marketVolatility: market.volatility / historicalVol,
        concentration: position.dv01 / totalDV01,
        timeOfDay: getMarketFatigue(market.time)
    };
    
    // Simple weighted score, fully transparent
    return Object.values(metrics)
        .reduce((sum, m) => sum + m, 0) / 4;
}

// User decides what to do with it
```

## Why This Can Work

### 1. Solves Real Pain
Every quant has written bump-and-revalue code. Everyone hates it.

### 2. Small Enough to Finish
One person can build this in 6 months.

### 3. Clear Value Proposition
"Calculate once, get all sensitivities."

### 4. Network Effects
More users = more adapters = more useful.

### 5. Timing Is Right
- WebAssembly makes JS fast enough
- Cloud adoption growing
- New generation of developers

## The $6M Learning

The loss wasn't about needing AI guardians. It was about:
- Cognitive overload
- Too many manual calculations
- Losing track of exposures
- Human limitations

Axiom helps by:
- Reducing manual work
- Making risks visible
- Freeing mental capacity
- Enabling better decisions

Not by blocking trades, but by making them clearer.

## Next Steps

### Week 1
- Set up GitHub repository
- Implement basic Dual class
- Write initial tests
- Create README

### Week 2
- Add financial operations
- Benchmark performance
- Memory profiling
- API refinement

### Week 3
- QuantLib adapter
- First examples
- Documentation
- Beta testers

### Week 4
- npm package
- Launch preparation
- Blog post draft
- Reach out to network

## Conclusion

**Original Axiom**: Trying to boil the ocean
**Revised Axiom**: Sharp tool for specific problem

By focusing on automatic differentiation only:
- Achievable by one person
- Solves real problem
- Clear business model
- Sustainable growth

The best products do one thing well. Axiom will make sensitivity calculations automatic. Nothing more, nothing less.

That's enough.
