# Gemini vs Claude: External Tools Integration Comparison

## Claude's Approach: Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Claude uses MCP servers that can be registered via CLI:
```bash
claude mcp add <name> -- <command>
```

This creates a persistent configuration where Claude can automatically discover and use tools exposed by MCP servers.

## Gemini's Approach: Function Calling API

Gemini uses a different approach:

1. **No Built-in CLI Registration**: Gemini doesn't have `gemini mcp add` or similar commands
2. **Function Calling**: You define functions in your application code
3. **Runtime Declaration**: Function schemas are passed with each API request
4. **Developer Orchestration**: Your code must handle function execution

### Example Gemini Function Calling Flow:

```javascript
// 1. Define your function schemas
const functions = [
  {
    name: "search_web",
    description: "Search the web using Brave Search",
    parameters: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        query: {
          type: "string",
          description: "The search query"
        }
      },
      required: ["query"]
    }
  }
];

// 2. Include functions in your API request
const response = await gemini.generateContent({
  contents: [{ parts: [{ text: "Search for MCP servers" }] }],
  tools: [{ functionDeclarations: functions }]
});

// 3. Handle function calls in the response
if (response.functionCall) {
  // Your code executes the function
  const result = await executeBraveSearch(response.functionCall.args);
  // Send result back to Gemini
}
```

## Key Differences

| Feature | Claude (MCP) | Gemini (Function Calling) |
|---------|--------------|---------------------------|
| Registration | Persistent CLI config | Runtime declaration |
| Discovery | Automatic via MCP protocol | Manual in each request |
| Execution | MCP server handles it | Your code handles it |
| Architecture | Decoupled microservices | Integrated in your app |

## Creating a Gemini Tools System

To replicate Claude's MCP functionality for Gemini, you would need to:

1. Build an orchestration layer that manages tool definitions
2. Create a runtime that can execute tool commands
3. Implement a registration system for tools
4. Handle the function calling flow with Gemini's API

This is essentially what the nova-mcp project does - it provides MCP-like functionality that could theoretically be adapted to work with Gemini's function calling API.
