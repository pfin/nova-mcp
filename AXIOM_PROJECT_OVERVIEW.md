# Axiom Project Overview

*The Self-Evident Truth in Quantitative Finance*

## Project Vision

Axiom is a next-generation quantitative finance library that combines:
- **QuantLib's** comprehensive coverage and computational accuracy
- **Rateslib's** elegant API and automatic differentiation
- **Modern** cloud-native architecture for real-time trading

Built by traders, for traders.

## Core Principles

1. **Speed is Non-Negotiable**: RV opportunities disappear in seconds
2. **Accuracy is Fundamental**: Basis points matter when leverage is 100:1
3. **Clarity Prevents Errors**: Complex strategies need simple interfaces
4. **Real-Time Risk**: Greeks must update as fast as markets move
5. **Cross-Asset by Design**: Modern RV spans rates, FX, and vol

## Key Features

### Automatic Differentiation Throughout
```javascript
// Every calculation returns value AND sensitivities
const swap = new Axiom.InterestRateSwap(params);
const result = swap.calculate();
console.log(result.value);    // NPV
console.log(result.delta);    // All DV01s automatically
console.log(result.gamma);    // Cross-gamma matrix
```

### Strategy Framework
```javascript
class TreasuryBasis extends Axiom.Strategy {
    calculateCTD() { /* ... */ }
    tradePnL(position, carryDays = 1) { /* ... */ }
    analyze() { /* ... */ }
}
```

## Why "Axiom"?

In mathematics, an axiom is a statement accepted as true without proof. In quantitative finance, certain truths are self-evident:
- Markets tend to mean-revert
- Arbitrage opportunities get competed away
- Risk must be measured in real-time
- Complexity requires clarity

Axiom embodies these fundamental truths.

## Project Status

- ‚úÖ Comprehensive analysis of rateslib and QuantLib completed
- ‚úÖ Detailed strategy implementations designed
- ‚úÖ Architecture decisions documented
- üîÑ Beginning core implementation
- ‚è≥ Seeking feedback on API design

## Next Steps

1. Implement `Axiom.Dual` for automatic differentiation
2. Create `Axiom.Curve` with multiple interpolation methods
3. Build `Axiom.Strategy` base class
4. Develop first strategy (Treasury Basis)
5. Integrate with Bloomberg API

## Contributing
