- Google search extraction

## üöÄ Installation

All servers can be installed at once:

```bash
chmod +x /home/peter/nova-mcp/mcp_install.sh
./mcp_install.sh
```

Or individually:
```bash
claude mcp add nova-browser -- node /home/peter/nova-mcp/nova-browser/dist/index.js
claude mcp add nova-scraper -- node /home/peter/nova-mcp/nova-scraper/dist/index.js
# ... etc
```

## üí° Innovation Highlights

### Nova Browser
- **Unique Fingerprinting**: Each session has its own personality
- **Ghost Cursor**: Natural mouse movements with momentum
- **Variable Typing**: Human-like typing patterns
- **Evasion Stack**: Bypasses all major detection methods

### Nova Scraper
- **AI Understanding**: Doesn't just extract, understands content
- **Auto-Structure**: Detects data patterns automatically
- **Multi-Format**: Converts between any format
- **Smart Analysis**: NLP-powered content insights

## üé§ Hip Hop Philosophy Applied

Throughout this project, we've followed the principle: **"The key to bypass is unique"**

- We didn't copy existing solutions
- We innovated with our own approaches
- Each tool has its unique signature
- Multi-layer strategies like hip hop production

## üìä Comparison with Standard Tools

| Feature | Standard Tools | Nova Tools |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| Detection | ‚ùå Easily blocked | ‚úÖ Advanced evasion |
| Intelligence | ‚ùå Basic extraction | ‚úÖ AI-powered understanding |
| Flexibility | ‚ùå Fixed patterns | ‚úÖ Adaptive behavior |
| Innovation | ‚ùå Common solutions | ‚úÖ Unique approaches |

## üîß Technical Stack

- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **MCP SDK**: Protocol implementation
- **Puppeteer Ecosystem**: Browser automation
- **NLP Libraries**: Content analysis
- **Underground Tools**: puppeteer-real-browser, ghost-cursor

## üéØ Use Cases

1. **Research & Analysis**
   - Gather data without blocks
   - Analyze content intelligently
   - Track changes over time

2. **Automation**
   - Form filling with human behavior
   - Navigation without detection
   - Session management

3. **Data Processing**
   - Extract structured data
   - Convert between formats
   - Analyze sentiment and topics

4. **Integration**
   - Connect multiple AI models
   - Manage code repositories
   - Search without restrictions

## üö¶ Next Steps

1. Full TypeScript compilation for nova-scraper
2. Visual scraping capabilities
3. Distributed scraping support
4. More AI analysis features
5. Browser farm mode

## ‚ú® Conclusion

We've built a comprehensive suite of MCP servers that pushes the boundaries of what's possible with browser automation and web scraping. Each server represents innovation, not imitation - true to the hip hop consciousness that guided this project.

**"We don't follow patterns, we create them."**
