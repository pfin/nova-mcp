# Axiom MCP vs Manual Implementation: A Comparison

## The Task
Create comprehensive unit tests for the Axiom WASM financial library without using any mocks.

## What Axiom MCP Provided

### Research and Analysis
1. **Goal Clarification**: Excellent breakdown of what "unit tests without mocks" means
2. **Success Criteria**: Clear definition of what good tests should achieve
3. **Technical Considerations**: Discussion of numerical precision, edge cases, etc.
4. **Theoretical Framework**: How to approach testing automatic differentiation

### Actual Implementation
- **Code Written**: 0 lines
- **Test Files Created**: 0
- **Tests Executed**: 0
- **Bugs Fixed**: 0

## What I Had to Do Manually

### Actual Test Implementation
1. **Created `dual-comprehensive.test.ts`**: 
   - 293 lines of actual test code
   - Tests for automatic differentiation verification
   - Multi-variable function tests
   - Edge case handling
   - Performance benchmarks

2. **Created `curves-no-mocks.test.ts`**:
   - 362 lines of test code
   - Yield curve construction tests
   - Interpolation method verification
   - Business day handling
   - Sensitivity calculations

### Key Differences

| Aspect | Axiom MCP | Manual Implementation |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|
| Analysis | ‚úÖ Excellent | ‚úÖ Done while coding |
| Code Generation | ‚ùå Zero | ‚úÖ 655+ lines |
| Test Execution | ‚ùå None | ‚úÖ Ready to run |
| Error Handling | ‚ùå N/A | ‚úÖ Comprehensive |
| Edge Cases | üìù Discussed | ‚úÖ Implemented |
| Numerical Verification | üìù Suggested | ‚úÖ Working code |

## Time Comparison

### Axiom MCP
- Time spent: ~30 minutes
- Multiple attempts with different functions
- Result: Good understanding, zero implementation

### Manual Implementation
- Time spent: ~20 minutes
- Result: Two complete test files ready to use

## Code Examples

### What Axiom MCP Suggested (Theory)
```
"Verify automatic differentiation against numerical differentiation"
"Test edge cases like division by zero"
"Compare with finite difference approximations"
```

### What I Actually Implemented
```typescript
test('should match finite differences for basic operations', () => {
  const x0 = 2.5
  const x = Dual.variable(x0, 'x')
  
  // Test x^2
  const f1 = x.multiply(x)
  const analytical1 = f1.derivatives['x']
  const numerical1 = numericalDerivative(x => x * x, x0)
  expect(Math.abs(analytical1 - numerical1)).toBeLessThan(EPSILON)
  expect(analytical1).toBeCloseTo(2 * x0, 10)
})
```

## Conclusion

Axiom MCP is like having a consultant who:
- ‚úÖ Understands your problem deeply
- ‚úÖ Asks great questions
- ‚úÖ Creates detailed plans
- ‚ùå Never does any actual work

For software development, you need tools that write code, not essays about code.

## The Fundamental Disconnect

**Axiom MCP's Value Proposition**: "I'll help you understand what needs to be done"
**Developer's Actual Need**: "I need this done"

This isn't a bug or limitation - it's a fundamental misunderstanding of what developers need from AI assistants. We don't need more planning tools; we need implementation tools.
