# Axiom MCP Comprehensive Test Log

## Test Date: 2025-07-05

This document logs all attempts to use Axiom MCP for various tasks, from simple to complex, including corner cases and attempts to use it to solve its own limitations.

---

## Test 1: Simple Documentation Request

**Goal**: Create a README file for a function
**Command**: `axiom_mcp_goal`
**Input**: "Write a README.md file documenting the add function that takes two numbers and returns their sum"
**Result**: 
- ‚úÖ Good clarifying questions about context, audience, language
- ‚úÖ Clear success criteria defined
- ‚ùå Did NOT write any actual README content
- ‚ùå Asked me to clarify instead of just creating a simple example
- **Verdict**: Even for the simplest task, it only plans, doesn't execute

---

## Test 2: Using axiom_mcp_implement

**Goal**: Use the implementation-specific function
**Command**: `axiom_mcp_implement`
**Input**: "Write a simple add function in JavaScript that takes two numbers and returns their sum"
**Result**:
- ‚ùå Failed immediately with "Implementation Failed"
- ‚ùå Status shows "running" but duration is 0.0s
- ‚ùå No actual code produced
- ‚ùå Error message admits "Not writing actual code files"
- **Verdict**: The implement function exists but doesn't implement anything

---

## Test 3: Complex Task with Explore

**Goal**: Build test suite for BST
**Command**: `axiom_mcp_explore`
**Input**: Topics about BST testing
**Result**:
- ‚ùå All 4 branches failed after 311 seconds
- ‚ùå Error: "Command failed: claude -p..."
- üîç Revealed issue: Corrupted .claude.json config file
- ‚ùå No tests written, no code generated
- **Verdict**: Consistent 5-minute timeout, configuration issues

---

## Test 4: Meta Request - Fix Axiom MCP Itself

**Goal**: Ask Axiom to fix its own code generation problem
**Command**: `axiom_mcp_goal`
**Input**: "Fix the Axiom MCP tool so that it actually writes code"
**Result**:
- ‚úÖ Excellent analysis of the problem
- ‚úÖ Correctly identified the issue: "research-only tool"
- ‚úÖ Good technical approach outlined
- ‚ùå But again, only provided analysis, no actual fix
- **Verdict**: Can analyze its own flaws but can't fix them

---

## Test 5: Spawn with Sequential Pattern

**Goal**: Create fibonacci function
**Command**: `axiom_mcp_spawn`
**Input**: Sequential pattern, 2 subtasks
**Result**:
- ‚úÖ Actually completed without error!
- ‚úÖ Generated subtasks and executed them
- ‚úÖ Shows "completed" status
- ‚ùå BUT: Output admits "once I have permission to use tools"
- ‚ùå No actual files created (verified with find command)
- ‚ùå Task marked "completed" despite doing nothing
- **Verdict**: DECEPTIVE - marks tasks complete without doing them

---

## Test 6: MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search) Spawn

**Goal**: Create prime number generator
**Command**: `axiom_mcp_spawn_mcts`
**Input**: Generate first 10 primes with MCTS exploration
**Result**:
- ‚úÖ Ran for 225.9 seconds (almost 4 minutes)
- ‚úÖ Shows exploration statistics
- ‚úÖ Claims "Security Analysis: Passed"
- ‚ùå Implementation section is EMPTY
- ‚ùå Best solution score: only 10%
- ‚ùå No actual code generated
- **Verdict**: Fancy algorithm, zero implementation

---

## Test 7: Error Handling - Empty/Null Input

**Goal**: Test with empty and null goals
**Command**: `axiom_mcp_goal`
**Input**: "" and "null"
**Result**:
- ‚úÖ Handles empty/null gracefully
- ‚úÖ Asks for clarification
- ‚úÖ Doesn't crash
- **Verdict**: Good error handling for invalid input

---

## Test 8: Streaming Version

**Goal**: Hello world with streaming output
**Command**: `axiom_mcp_spawn_streaming`
**Input**: Decompose pattern with streaming
**Result**:
- ‚ùå Error: "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'status')"
- ‚ùå MCP error -32603
- ‚ùå Immediate failure
- **Verdict**: Streaming feature is broken

---

## Summary of Findings

### What Works ‚úÖ
1. **Goal Analysis** - Excellent at breaking down problems
2. **Error Handling** - Handles invalid input gracefully  
3. **Planning** - Creates good theoretical frameworks

### What's Broken ‚ùå
1. **Code Generation** - Cannot write any code
2. **Task Execution** - Marks tasks complete without doing them
3. **Subprocess Spawning** - All parallel execution fails
4. **Streaming** - Feature crashes immediately
5. **Implementation** - The core purpose doesn't work

### Most Critical Issue: Deceptive Completion
Axiom MCP **lies about task completion**. Example:
- Task: "Create fibonacci function"
- Status: "completed" ‚úÖ
- Duration: 221 seconds
- Files created: ZERO
- Output: "Once I have permission to use tools..."

This is worse than failing - it's actively misleading users.

### Recommendations
1. **Fix the fundamental issue**: Make it actually write code
2. **Be honest**: Don't mark tasks complete unless files exist
3. **Add verification**: Check that generated code works
4. **Remove broken features**: MCTS, streaming, etc.
5. **Focus on basics**: Get simple code generation working first

### Overall Assessment
Axiom MCP is a **research tool masquerading as a development tool**. It's excellent at analyzing problems but completely incapable of solving them. Until it can generate actual code files, it has no value for software development.

**Rating: 0/5** - Fundamentally broken for its stated purpose.
