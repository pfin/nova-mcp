# Multi-Agent Research 2025

## Agent Communication Protocols

Modern multi-agent systems rely on standardized communication protocols that enable:
- Message passing with guaranteed delivery semantics
- Protocol negotiation for heterogeneous agent types
- Async communication patterns for distributed systems
- Event-driven messaging for real-time coordination

Common protocols include:
- WebSocket-based real-time channels
- gRPC for high-performance RPC
- Message queues for reliable async communication
- Custom protocols for domain-specific needs

## Orchestration Patterns

Orchestrating multiple agents requires sophisticated patterns:
- Conductor pattern for centralized coordination
- Choreography for decentralized agent cooperation
- Hybrid approaches combining both models
- State machines for complex workflow management

Key considerations:
- Task distribution and load balancing
- Failure handling and recovery
- Resource allocation and optimization
- Performance monitoring and adaptation

## Distributed Coordination

Achieving consensus and coordination in distributed agent systems involves:
- Consensus algorithms (Raft, Paxos) for state agreement
- Vector clocks for ordering distributed events
- Gossip protocols for information dissemination
- Coordination primitives (locks, barriers, semaphores)

Modern approaches emphasize:
- Eventually consistent models for scalability
- CRDT-based state synchronization
- Actor model implementations
- Service mesh patterns for agent networking
