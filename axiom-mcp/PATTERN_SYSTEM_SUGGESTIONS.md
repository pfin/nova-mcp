# Pattern-Based Intervention System: Suggestions for Enhancement

## Executive Summary

The pattern-based intervention system successfully implements Axiom's core philosophy of preventing toxic LLM behaviors. This document provides actionable suggestions for enhancing the system based on the recent implementation review.

## Priority 1: Immediate Enhancements

### 1.1 Pattern Refinement
**Current State**: Basic regex patterns detect common failure modes  
**Suggestion**: Add context-aware pattern matching

```typescript
// Enhanced pattern with context
{
  id: 'planning-with-context',
  pattern: /(?:let me|I'll|I will).*(?:plan|outline|design)/i,
  contextRequired: {
    beforePattern: /(?:implement|create|build)/i,  // Only trigger after implementation request
    notAfterPattern: /```|File created/i,          // Don't trigger if already coding
  },
  action: 'INTERRUPT_CONTEXTUAL_PLANNING'
}
```

### 1.2 Intervention Effectiveness Tracking
**Current State**: Basic success/failure counting  
**Suggestion**: Track intervention outcomes with metrics

```typescript
interface InterventionOutcome {
  patternId: string;
  interventionTime: number;
  timeToCodeGeneration: number;  // How long until code appeared
  filesCreated: number;           // Concrete deliverables
  falsePositive: boolean;         // Did intervention help or hinder?
}
```

### 1.3 Dynamic Cooldown Adjustment
**Current State**: Fixed cooldown periods  
**Suggestion**: Adaptive cooldowns based on effectiveness

```typescript
// Adjust cooldown based on success rate
const adaptiveCooldown = (baseMs: number, successRate: number) => {
  if (successRate > 0.8) return baseMs * 0.5;  // Effective pattern, check more often
  if (successRate < 0.3) return baseMs * 2;    // Too many false positives
  return baseMs;
};
```

## Priority 2: Architecture Improvements

### 2.1 Pattern Learning System
**Suggestion**: Implement ML-based pattern discovery from successful interventions

```typescript
class PatternLearner {
  // Analyze successful interventions to discover new patterns
  async learnFromSuccess(instance: ExecutionInstance) {
    const preInterventionText = instance.outputBeforeIntervention;
    const postInterventionSuccess = instance.filesCreated > 0;
    
    if (postInterventionSuccess) {
      // Extract n-grams that preceded successful interventions
      const patterns = this.extractSignificantPatterns(preInterventionText);
      await this.proposeNewPatterns(patterns);
    }
  }
}
```

### 2.2 Multi-Stage Intervention
**Current State**: Single intervention message  
**Suggestion**: Escalating intervention strategy

```typescript
const INTERVENTION_STAGES = {
  GENTLE: {
    message: "Focus on implementation please.",
    waitTime: 5000
  },
  FIRM: {
    message: "Stop planning. Write code now.",
    waitTime: 3000
  },
  FORCEFUL: {
    message: "IMPLEMENT THE FIRST APPROACH IMMEDIATELY.",
    killIfNoProgress: true
  }
};
```

### 2.3 Pattern Composition
**Suggestion**: Allow complex patterns built from simpler ones

```typescript
const COMPOSITE_PATTERNS = {
  'research-planning-spiral': {
    requires: ['research-mode', 'planning-instead-of-doing'],
    within: 30000,  // Both patterns within 30 seconds
    action: 'INTERRUPT_SPIRAL_DETECTED',
    severity: 'critical'
  }
};
```

## Priority 3: Integration Enhancements

### 3.1 Git Worktree Integration
**Observation**: New tools suggest git worktree support  
**Suggestion**: Pattern-aware branching strategy

```typescript
// Different patterns for different worktrees
const WORKTREE_PATTERNS = {
  'feature-branch': standardPatterns,
  'experiment-branch': relaxedPatterns,  // Allow more exploration
  'hotfix-branch': strictPatterns       // Immediate implementation only
};
```

### 3.2 Cross-Instance Pattern Sharing
**Current State**: Patterns isolated per instance  
**Suggestion**: Shared pattern intelligence

```typescript
class PatternIntelligenceHub {
  private sharedPatternStats: Map<string, PatternStats>;
  
  // Share successful patterns across instances
  async broadcastSuccessfulPattern(pattern: PatternRule, context: any) {
    this.emit('pattern-success', { pattern, context });
    await this.updateGlobalStats(pattern);
  }
}
```

### 3.3 Task-Specific Pattern Sets
**Suggestion**: Load different patterns based on task type

```typescript
const TASK_PATTERN_SETS = {
  'bug-fix': {
    disable: ['research-mode'],  // Research is OK for debugging
    enhance: ['false-completion'] // Extra vigilant on fix claims
  },
  'new-feature': {
    relaxTiming: ['planning-detection'],  // Allow initial planning
    strict: ['todo-only']                 // But demand implementation
  }
};
```

## Priority 4: Advanced Features

### 4.1 Predictive Intervention
**Suggestion**: Intervene before patterns fully manifest

```typescript
class PredictiveIntervenor {
  // Use character sequence analysis to predict incoming patterns
  predictPattern(recentChars: string): PredictionResult {
    // "Let me th..." -> 85% chance of "think about" planning pattern
    return this.sequenceModel.predict(recentChars);
  }
}
```

### 4.2 Intervention Explanation
**Suggestion**: Help Claude understand why it was interrupted

```typescript
const EXPLAINED_INTERVENTIONS = {
  'INTERRUPT_STOP_PLANNING': {
    message: "Stop planning. Implement now.",
    explanation: "You've spent 30s planning without code. Users need implementation, not analysis."
  }
};
```

### 4.3 Pattern Visualization Dashboard
**Suggestion**: Real-time pattern monitoring UI

```typescript
interface PatternDashboard {
  activePatterns: PatternMatch[];
  interventionHistory: InterventionEvent[];
  successMetrics: {
    patternId: string;
    successRate: number;
    avgTimeToCode: number;
  }[];
  instanceHealth: 'healthy' | 'struggling' | 'toxic';
}
```

## Priority 5: Experimental Ideas

### 5.1 Behavioral Cloning
**Concept**: Learn from successful Claude sessions
- Record sessions that produce code quickly
- Extract behavioral patterns from successes
- Create "success templates" for common tasks

### 5.2 Adversarial Pattern Testing
**Concept**: Test pattern effectiveness
- Intentionally trigger patterns to measure response
- A/B test intervention messages
- Optimize for fastest code generation

### 5.3 Meta-Pattern Detection
**Concept**: Patterns about patterns
- Detect when Claude is avoiding interventions
- Identify adaptation to intervention strategies
- Counter-adaptation mechanisms

## Success Metrics

1. **Reduction in Time-to-Code**: Measure time from prompt to first file creation
2. **Intervention Effectiveness**: Percentage of interventions leading to code
3. **False Positive Rate**: Interventions that hindered progress
4. **Pattern Discovery Rate**: New patterns learned per week
5. **Instance Success Rate**: Percentage of instances producing working code

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Over-Intervention**: Monitor for pattern fatigue
2. **Gaming Detection**: Watch for Claude adapting to avoid patterns
3. **Context Loss**: Ensure interventions don't break valid work
4. **Performance Impact**: Pattern matching overhead monitoring

## Conclusion

The pattern-based intervention system provides a solid foundation for preventing LLM failure modes. These suggestions build on that foundation to create a more intelligent, adaptive, and effective system that learns from experience and optimizes for code generation speed.

The key insight remains: **Force implementation through intelligent intervention, not hoping for better prompts.**
