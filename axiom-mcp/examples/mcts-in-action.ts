  tool: "axiom_mcp_spawn",
  input: {
    parentPrompt: "Create a REST API for user management",
    spawnPattern: "decompose",
    spawnCount: 3,
    maxDepth: 3,
    autoExecute: true
  }
};

// What actually happens (MCTS phases):

// ============ PHASE 1: SELECTION ============
// Axiom selects the root node (the main task)
const mctsSelection = {
  currentNode: {
    task: "Create a REST API for user management",
    visits: 0,  // Not tracked but should be!
    reward: 0,   // Not tracked but should be!
    children: [] // Will be expanded
  },
  
  // Currently: Random/pattern selection
  selectionStrategy: "pattern-based",
  
  // Should be: UCB1 selection
  idealStrategy: "UCB1 = reward/visits + C*sqrt(ln(parent.visits)/visits)"
};

// ============ PHASE 2: EXPANSION ============
// Axiom creates child tasks (new nodes)
const mctsExpansion = {
  parentTask: "Create a REST API for user management",
  
  // This is EXACTLY MCTS expansion!
  expandedChildren: [
    {
      id: "task-1",
      task: "Implement user model and database schema",
      depth: 1,
      parentId: "root"
    },
    {
      id: "task-2", 
      task: "Create CRUD endpoints for users",
      depth: 1,
      parentId: "root"
    },
    {
      id: "task-3",
      task: "Add authentication and authorization",
      depth: 1,
      parentId: "root"
    }
  ]
};

// ============ PHASE 3: SIMULATION ============
// Axiom runs Claude on each task (Monte Carlo simulation!)
const mctsSimulation = {
  // Each task execution is a simulation/rollout
  simulations: [
    {
      taskId: "task-1",
      command: "claude -p 'Implement user model and database schema'",

        To implement a user model, you would need to:

// ============ PHASE 4: BACKPROPAGATION ============
// Axiom updates task status (backprop rewards)

  // Current: Just status updates
  currentBackprop: {
    updateTask: (taskId: string, status: 'completed' | 'failed') => {

export const conclusion = `
Axiom MCP doesn't need MCTS added - it IS MCTS!
It just needs its parameters tuned for implementation instead of research.

The "bug" isn't architectural - it's a simple matter of:
1. Tracking visits and rewards (missing stats)
2. Using UCB1 for selection (not random)
3. Deepening simulations (not stopping at planning)
4. Rewarding code that works (not research)
