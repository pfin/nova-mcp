# Using Axiom MCP to Research AI Agent Techniques

This example demonstrates how to use Axiom MCP itself to research and integrate new AI agent orchestration techniques.

## Example: Researching Recursive Task Spawning Techniques

```typescript
// Use Axiom MCP to research its own improvements
axiom_mcp_spawn({
  parentPrompt: `Research and implement improvements to Axiom MCP based on 2025 AI agent techniques:
    1. Find recursive task spawning patterns from June-July 2025
    2. Identify quality evaluation methods for AI-generated code
    3. Discover solutions for parallel execution failures
    4. Research code-first implementation approaches`,
  spawnPattern: "decompose",
  spawnCount: 4,
  maxDepth: 3,
  autoExecute: true
})
```

```

## Integration Process

1. **Research Phase** (Current Axiom MCP capability)
   ```typescript
   // This works today - generates research and analysis
   const research = await axiom_mcp_spawn({
     parentPrompt: "Research recursive AI agent patterns",
     spawnPattern: "parallel",
     spawnCount: 3
   });
   ```

2. **Implementation Phase** (Proposed for v2.0)
   ```typescript
   // This is what we need - actual implementation
   const implementation = await axiom_mcp_implement({
     task: "Implement recursive task spawning with verification",
     basedOn: research.findings,
     verifyWith: ["npm test", "security scan"],
     contextFiles: ["src/**/*.ts"],
     acceptanceCriteria: {
       hasWorkingCode: true,
       testsPass: true,
       noVulnerabilities: true
     }
   });
   ```

## Using Research to Drive Implementation

### Step 1: Research Current Techniques
```bash
# Use Axiom MCP to research techniques
axiom_mcp_goals define --objective "Find and implement 2025 AI agent patterns"
axiom_mcp_spawn --prompt "Research recursive task spawning June 2025"
```

### Step 2: Evaluate Research Quality
```bash
# Current: Evaluates research quality
axiom_mcp_evaluate --taskId <id> --criteria "Has specific examples"

# Needed: Evaluates implementation quality
axiom_mcp_evaluate --taskId <id> --criteria "Has working code that passes tests"
```

### Step 3: Merge and Synthesize
```bash
# Merge findings from multiple research branches
axiom_mcp_merge --tasks task1,task2,task3 --strategy synthesize
```

## Key Insights from Using Axiom MCP on Itself

1. **The Tool Exposes Its Own Limitations**
   - When asked to improve itself, it provides excellent analysis
   - But cannot implement any of the improvements it suggests
   - This recursive self-analysis highlights the implementation gap

2. **Research Quality vs Implementation Quality**
   - Current: High-quality research and planning
   - Missing: Any actual code or implementation
   - Needed: Balance between understanding and doing

3. **Parallel Execution Issues**
   - Research shows modern frameworks support parallel agents
   - Axiom MCP's parallel execution consistently fails
   - Points to fundamental architectural issues

## Conclusion

Using Axiom MCP to research its own improvements is a perfect demonstration of both its strengths (excellent research and analysis) and its critical weakness (no implementation). The tool can brilliantly analyze what needs to be done but cannot do any of it.

This meta-analysis reinforces the need for the v2.0 redesign focused on **implementation-first** architecture.
