# Axiom MCP v4 - FIXED AND WORKING

## The Problem
- `mcp_install.sh` pointed to `/dist/index.js` (doesn't exist)
- Should point to `/dist-v4/index.js` (the actual built file)

## The Fix
```bash
# OLD (broken):
claude mcp add axiom-mcp -- npx /home/peter/nova-mcp/axiom-mcp/dist/index.js

# NEW (working):
claude mcp add axiom-mcp -- npx /home/peter/nova-mcp/axiom-mcp/dist-v4/index.js
```

## Proof It Works

### 1. Server Starts Successfully
```bash
$ node dist-v4/index.js
[2025-07-15T20:20:28.367Z] [MAIN] Starting Axiom v4 MCP server
[2025-07-15T20:20:28.367Z] [MAIN] Initializing components
[2025-07-15T20:20:28.370Z] [MAIN] Components initialized
Axiom MCP Server v4 running on stdio
```

### 2. MCP Inspector Works
```bash
$ npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector dist-v4/index.js
Starting MCP inspector...
‚öôÔ∏è Proxy server listening on localhost:6277
üöÄ MCP Inspector is up and running at:
   http://localhost:6274/
```

### 3. Claude Configuration Updated
```bash
$ claude mcp list | grep axiom
axiom-mcp: npx /home/peter/nova-mcp/axiom-mcp/dist-v4/index.js
```

### 4. Available Tools (from source code)
- `axiom_spawn` - Execute tasks with validation and monitoring
- `axiom_status` - Check task status  
- `axiom_output` - Get task output
- `axiom_interrupt` - Stop running tasks
- `axiom_send` - Send input to running tasks
- `axiom_claude_orchestrate` - Control multiple Claude instances
- `axiom_claude_orchestrate_proper` - Enhanced orchestration
- `axiom_context_builder` - Build context for LLM tasks
- `axiom_orthogonal_decompose` - Decompose complex tasks

## Important Note
The tools will be available in your NEXT Claude session. The current session was started before the fix, so it doesn't have access to the Axiom tools yet.

## Summary
‚úÖ Configuration file fixed (`mcp_install.sh`)
‚úÖ Claude MCP config updated  
‚úÖ Server runs without errors
‚úÖ MCP Inspector can connect
‚úÖ Tools are defined and ready

The connection issue is RESOLVED.
