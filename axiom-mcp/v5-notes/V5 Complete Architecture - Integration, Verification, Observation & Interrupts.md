# V5 Complete Architecture - Integration, Verification, Observation & Interrupts

## Corrected Phase Architecture

### Phase 1: Research (3 min)
**Tools**: Read, Search, Grep, Analyze
**Output**: research-findings.md
**Observer**: Detects endless loops, forces conclusion

### Phase 2: Planning (3 min) 
**Tools**: Read findings, Memory, Think
**Output**: orthogonal-task-plan.json
**Observer**: Prevents over-planning, enforces decisions

### Phase 3: Execution (10 min)
**Tools**: Write ONLY, mkdir
**Output**: Files created
**Observer**: Kills if no files, prevents explanations

### Phase 4: Integration (5 min) - NEEDS THINKING TOOLS
**Tools**: Read, Analyze, Think, Write
**Purpose**: Complex reasoning to combine components
**Output**: Working integrated system
**Observer**: Ensures actual integration, not just copying

### Phase 5: Verification (3 min) - NEW PHASE
**Tools**: Read, Test, Execute, Validate
**Purpose**: Verify the integration actually works
**Output**: Test results, validation report
**Observer**: Ensures real verification, not assumptions

## Observer System - The Rule Enforcer

```typescript
class PhaseObserver {
  private interventionRules: Map<Phase, Rule[]> = new Map([
    ['research', [
      { pattern: /Let me also check|Additionally|Furthermore/, 
        trigger: 'RESEARCH_LOOP', 
        action: 'FORCE_CONCLUDE' },
      { pattern: /I should look at|Maybe I should/, 
        trigger: 'SCOPE_CREEP', 
        action: 'LIMIT_SCOPE' }
    ]],
    ['planning', [
      { pattern: /I could also|Another approach|Let me think more/, 
        trigger: 'OVER_PLANNING', 
        action: 'FORCE_DECISION' },
      { pattern: /This is complex|Many considerations/, 
        trigger: 'ANALYSIS_PARALYSIS', 
        action: 'SIMPLIFY_NOW' }
    ]],
    ['execution', [
      { pattern: /I would|Let me check|First I need to/, 
        trigger: 'THINKING_IN_EXECUTION', 
        action: 'FORCE_CREATE' },
      { pattern: /To implement this|The approach is/, 
        trigger: 'EXPLAINING_NOT_DOING', 
        action: 'CREATE_FILE_NOW' }
    ]],
    ['integration', [
      { pattern: /Simply copy|Just combine|Merge the files/, 
        trigger: 'SHALLOW_INTEGRATION', 
        action: 'FORCE_DEEP_THINKING' },
      { pattern: /This should work|Looks good/, 
        trigger: 'ASSUMPTION_MODE', 
        action: 'VERIFY_CONNECTIONS' }
    ]],
    ['verification', [
      { pattern: /Appears to work|Should be fine/, 
        trigger: 'FAKE_VERIFICATION', 
        action: 'RUN_ACTUAL_TESTS' },
      { pattern: /I assume|Probably works/, 
        trigger: 'NO_VERIFICATION', 
        action: 'EXECUTE_AND_CHECK' }
    ]]
  ]);
}
```

## Interrupt System - When, How, Why

### Interrupt Triggers

1. **Time-based Interrupts**
   ```typescript
   interface TimeInterrupt {
     phase: Phase;
     softWarning: number;  // 80% of time limit
     hardInterrupt: number; // 100% of time limit
     action: 'WARN' | 'FORCE_CONCLUDE' | 'KILL_AND_RETRY';
   }
   ```

2. **Pattern-based Interrupts**
   ```typescript
   interface PatternInterrupt {
     pattern: RegExp;
     context: string; // What phase/situation
     cooldown: number; // Don't repeat for N seconds
     action: InterruptAction;
   }
   ```

3. **Progress-based Interrupts**
   ```typescript
   interface ProgressInterrupt {
     phase: Phase;
     expectedOutput: string;
     checkInterval: number; // Every N seconds
     noProgressTime: number; // Kill after N seconds of no progress
   }
   ```

### Interrupt Actions

```typescript
enum InterruptAction {
  SOFT_NUDGE = 'Type gentle reminder',
  FIRM_REDIRECT = 'Clear directive with ESC',
  FORCE_PHASE_END = 'ESC + phase transition command',
  KILL_AND_RESTART = 'Kill process, start fresh',
  ESCALATE_TO_HUMAN = 'Too many failures, need help'
}
```

### Integration Phase Interrupt Examples

```typescript
const integrationInterrupts = [
  {
    trigger: "I'll just put these files together",
    action: "NO! Integration requires THINKING. Analyze dependencies, resolve conflicts, create proper interfaces. Think first!",
    timing: "Immediate"
  },
  {
    trigger: "The components should work together",
    action: "SHOULD isn't good enough. READ the files, UNDERSTAND the interfaces, VERIFY compatibility.",
    timing: "After 30 seconds of assumptions"
  },
  {
    trigger: "Let me copy the auth from one file to another",
    action: "STOP! Design proper auth flow. Think about: data flow, error handling, edge cases.",
    timing: "When detecting copy-paste"
  }
];
```

## Hook Integration System

### Pre-Phase Hooks
```typescript
interface PrePhaseHook {
  phase: Phase;
  validate: (context: PhaseContext) => boolean;
  prepare: (context: PhaseContext) => PhaseContext;
  
  // Example: Ensure research phase has clear scope
  researchScopeHook: (context) => {
    if (!context.scope) {
      context.scope = "Focus on: " + inferScopeFromPrompt(context.prompt);
    }
    return context;
  }
}
```

### During-Phase Hooks
```typescript
interface DuringPhaseHook {
  pattern: RegExp;
  action: (match: string, context: PhaseContext) => InterruptAction;
  
  // Example: Integration thinking enforcement
  integrationThinkingHook: {
    pattern: /simply|just|copy|merge/i,
    action: (match, context) => ({
      type: 'FORCE_THINKING',
      message: `You said "${match}" - that's not integration thinking. Analyze: What are the interfaces? What are the dependencies? How do errors propagate?`
    })
  }
}
```

### Post-Phase Hooks
```typescript
interface PostPhaseHook {
  phase: Phase;
  validate: (output: PhaseOutput) => ValidationResult;
  
  // Example: Execution phase must create files
  executionValidation: (output) => {
    const files = findCreatedFiles(output.workspace);
    if (files.length === 0) {
      return { valid: false, reason: "No files created", action: "RETRY_EXECUTION" };
    }
    return { valid: true };
  }
}
```

## Verifier System - The Truth Checker

```typescript
class IntegrationVerifier {
  async verify(workspace: string, expectedBehavior: string): Promise<VerificationResult> {
    const checks = [
      this.checkSyntaxValid(workspace),
      this.checkImportsResolve(workspace),
      this.checkInterfacesMatch(workspace),
      this.checkDataFlow(workspace),
      this.checkErrorHandling(workspace),
      this.runBasicTests(workspace, expectedBehavior)
    ];
    
    const results = await Promise.all(checks);
    return this.aggregateResults(results);
  }
  
  private async checkInterfacesMatch(workspace: string): Promise<CheckResult> {
    // Read all files, parse exports/imports
    // Verify that what's exported matches what's imported
    // Flag mismatches for integration phase to fix
  }
  
  private async checkDataFlow(workspace: string): Promise<CheckResult> {
    // Trace data flow between components
    // Ensure types match, no orphaned data
    // Verify error propagation paths
  }
}
```

## Complete Flow with Interrupts

### 1. Research Phase (3 min)
```
Observer watches for:
- "Let me also check..." → INTERRUPT: "Scope creep detected. Conclude research now."
- Time > 2.5 min → SOFT_NUDGE: "30 seconds left, wrap up findings"
- Time > 3 min → FORCE_CONCLUDE: ESC + "End research. Write findings.md now."

Success: research-findings.md created
Failure: Retry once, then escalate
```

### 2. Planning Phase (3 min)
```
Observer watches for:
- "Another approach..." → INTERRUPT: "Over-planning detected. Make a decision."
- "This is complex..." → INTERRUPT: "Simplify! Pick one approach and commit."
- No task-plan.json after 2.5 min → FORCE_DECISION

Success: orthogonal-task-plan.json with clear tasks
Failure: Generate default decomposition
```

### 3. Execution Phase (10 min)
```
Observer watches for:
- "I would implement..." → INTERRUPT: "NO EXPLAINING! Create the file: touch filename.js"
- No files after 5 min → INTERRUPT: "Where are the files? Create them NOW!"
- Reading/searching attempts → BLOCK_TOOL: "Execution phase = write only"

Success: All expected files exist
Failure: Kill non-productive instances, retry with clearer prompts
```

### 4. Integration Phase (5 min) - THINKING ALLOWED
```
Observer watches for:
- "Simply combine..." → INTERRUPT: "Think deeper! What are the interfaces?"
- "Should work..." → INTERRUPT: "Verify assumptions. Read the actual code."
- No integration file after 3 min → FORCE_THINKING: "Analyze dependencies first!"

Success: Working integrated system
Failure: Hand to human with analysis of what went wrong
```

### 5. Verification Phase (3 min)
```
Observer watches for:
- "Looks good..." → INTERRUPT: "Test it! Run actual verification."
- "Probably works..." → INTERRUPT: "PROBABLY isn't good enough. Execute and check."

Success: Verified working system
Failure: Back to integration with specific error report
```

## The Complete V5 Innovation

By adding proper integration thinking, verification, and comprehensive interrupts, V5 becomes:

1. **Phase-aware**: Different rules and tools per phase
2. **Observer-enforced**: Continuous pattern monitoring
3. **Interrupt-driven**: Real-time course correction
4. **Hook-integrated**: Extensible intervention system
5. **Verifier-validated**: Actual testing, not assumptions

This creates a system that can reliably go from idea to verified working code in ~24 minutes with observable progress and forced quality gates.
