# Axiom v5 Parallel Executor - Implementation Summary

## What We Built

Created the core Parallel Executor system at `src-v5/executors/parallel-executor.ts` that manages multiple Claude instances running in parallel.

### Key Features

1. **Parallel Instance Management**
   - Spawn up to 10 Claude instances simultaneously
   - Each instance gets isolated workspace directory
   - Monitor all instances in real-time
   - Track productivity metrics per instance

2. **Aggressive Killing Protocol**
   - Kill idle instances after 30 seconds
   - Kill unproductive instances after 2 minutes
   - Productivity score based on:
     - Output rate (lines/second)
     - Files created
     - Time since last activity
   - Minimum score threshold: 20/100

3. **Task Distribution**
   - Queue-based task assignment
   - Automatic redistribution of failed tasks
   - Support for task dependencies
   - Priority-based scheduling

4. **Monitoring & Intervention**
   - Real-time stream monitoring
   - File creation detection
   - Stuck instance detection
   - Manual intervention support

## Files Created

1. `/src-v5/executors/parallel-executor.ts` - Core executor implementation
2. `/src-v5/index.ts` - v5 module exports
3. `/src-v5/test-parallel.ts` - Test script
4. `/src-v5/tools/axiom-parallel-tool.ts` - MCP tool integration
5. `/tsconfig.v5.json` - TypeScript configuration
6. `/docs/PARALLEL_EXECUTOR_DESIGN.md` - Design documentation

## Current Status

- ✅ Core parallel executor logic implemented
- ✅ Aggressive instance killing implemented  
- ✅ Task queue and distribution system
- ✅ Productivity scoring algorithm
- ✅ MCP tool wrappers created
- ⚠️ Using stub PtyExecutor (needs integration with real v4 executor)
- ⚠️ Task decomposition is basic (needs smart decomposer)

## Next Steps

1. **Integration with v4 PtyExecutor**
   - Import real PtyExecutor from v4
   - Test with actual Claude CLI instances
   - Verify file creation detection

2. **Smart Task Decomposition**
   - Implement orthogonal task splitting
   - Detect dependencies automatically
   - Create task DAGs

3. **Testing**
   - Integration tests with real Claude
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Stress testing with 10 instances

## Shadow Protocol Notes

The executor is intentionally brutal about killing underperforming instances. This is by design - we want to fail fast and redistribute work rather than wait for sluggish instances. The productivity scoring is tuned to favor:

- Immediate code output
- File creation
- Consistent activity

And penalize:
- Long silences
- TODO list generation
- Research without implementation
