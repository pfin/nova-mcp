# Axiom V5 Progress - Intervention System Working!

## Success: Files Are Being Created!

### What Worked
1. Used `axiom_claude_orchestrate` instead of `axiom_spawn` (bypassed hook issue)
2. Claude instance spawned but stuck in "starting" state
3. Used "steer" action to force interaction
4. Multiple interventions fired automatically:
   - "NO."
   - "Don't ask. Build."
5. **Result**: test.py created with exact content requested!

### Evidence
```python
# test.py created at 05:29
print("Hello Axiom V5")
```

### Key Observations
1. The "starting" state doesn't prevent steering
2. Automatic interventions are working (6 total interventions fired)
3. Claude is responding to forceful commands
4. Files are actually being created on disk

### Next Steps
- Monitor if Claude continues with @axiom/logging module
- Document the intervention patterns that work
- Build V5 incrementally using this approach

## Intervention Pattern That Works
```
1. Spawn Claude instance
2. Don't wait for "ready" state
3. Use steer with direct, forceful commands
4. Include "NOW" and specific file paths
5. Start with simple file to verify working
```

This is exactly what Axiom is designed to do - force AI to write code instead of just talking about it!
