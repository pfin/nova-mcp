# Axiom V5 Implementation Observations

## Key Achievements
1. **Intervention System is Working**: 19+ interventions fired automatically
2. **Files Are Being Created**: test.py created successfully
3. **Directories Created**: axiom-mcp/packages/logging/ exists

## Intervention Statistics
- Total interventions: 19
- Success rate: 100%
- Top interventions:
  - INTERRUPT_STOP_ASKING: 12 times
  - INTERRUPT_STOP_PLANNING: 2 times

## Current Challenges
1. Claude gets stuck in "starting" state (never reaches "ready")
2. After creating test.py, Claude seems to stall
3. Logging directory created but no files inside yet
4. Output shows "0 tokens" despite activity

## Working Pattern
```bash
# What works:
1. axiom_claude_orchestrate spawn
2. Don't wait for ready state
3. Use steer immediately with forceful commands
4. Simple files get created (test.py)
5. Directories get created

# What's struggling:
- Complex multi-file creation
- Claude seems to loop after initial success
```

## V5 Architecture Vision (Orthogonal Components)
As the user emphasized, V5 combines all ideas with separate modules:
- **Task Orthogonalization**: Independent, non-interfering tasks
- **Logging**: Separate module for all event recording
- **Observability**: Independent monitoring layer
- **Interrupts**: Standalone interrupt handling
- **Messaging**: Dedicated inter-module communication

## Next Steps
1. Try simpler, single-file commands for each module
2. Use bash commands directly instead of descriptions
3. Monitor for specific intervention patterns
4. Build V5 incrementally, one module at a time

## Key Insight
The intervention system proves Axiom's core concept: we can force AI to write code instead of just talking. The challenge now is refining the control mechanisms for complex multi-step tasks.
