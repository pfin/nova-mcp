# Axiom MCP V3 Observations & Development Guide

## Current State (2025-01-06 17:21)

### ✅ What's Working
1. **Task Decomposition**: Successfully breaks down complex tasks into logical subtasks
2. **Parent-Child Relationships**: Proper task tree structure with IDs and relationships
3. **Task Type Detection**: Correctly identifies task types (general, implementation, etc.)
4. **MCP Tool Integration**: axiom_mcp_spawn and axiom_mcp_status tools are callable
5. **No Authentication**: Successfully removed all auth/security scanning per user request

### ❌ Critical Issues
1. **Execution Gap**: Tasks are created but NEVER executed
   - PTY executor exists but isn't connected to task runner
   - All tasks remain in "pending" state
   - Parent shows "completed" with 0% progress
   
2. **No File Output**: Despite promises to write code, no files are created
   - factorial.py was never written
   - No Python or TypeScript files generated
   
3. **Missing Execution Loop**: After spawning tasks, nothing triggers their execution

### 🔍 Key Observations

#### From Baseline Test (factorial.py)
- Simple task spawned in 8 seconds
- Created 1 subtask successfully
- Task marked complete but no file created
- PTY executor never invoked

#### From Complex Test (Web Scraper)
- Excellent decomposition into 4 logical subtasks
- Properly separated Python and TypeScript components
- All 4 tasks remain pending
- No attempt to execute any subtask

### 🎯 Immediate Priorities

1. **Fix Claude CLI Execution** (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
   - Current issue: Uses `claude --print` which asks for permission
   - Line 78: `const claudeArgs = ['--print'];`
   - Need to remove `--print` flag to enable direct execution
   - PTY executor is connected but hampered by permission prompts

2. **Add Execution Verification**
   - Check if files were created
   - Verify code was written
   - Fail loudly if only research happened

3. **Fix Progress Tracking**
   - Update task status during execution
   - Show real progress percentages
   - Mark tasks complete only after verification

### 🏗️ Architecture Insights

#### Current Flow
```
User Request → axiom_mcp_spawn → Task Decomposition → Task Tree → ❌ STOP
```

#### Needed Flow
```
User Request → axiom_mcp_spawn → Task Decomposition → Task Tree → PTY Execution → File Verification → Status Update
```

### 📊 Development Metrics
- **Tests Run**: 2
- **Success Rate**: 0% (no actual execution)
- **Files Created**: 0
- **Tasks Executed**: 0/5

### 🚀 Next Steps
1. Open axiom-mcp-spawn.ts and find task creation code
2. Add execution loop with PTY executor
3. Test with simple factorial task
4. Verify file creation
5. Move to observability system

### 💡 Development Philosophy
> "Execution over planning. If it doesn't create files, it's not working."
