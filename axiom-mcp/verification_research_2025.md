# Verification Research 2025

## Testing Frameworks for Distributed Systems

Modern verification approaches for distributed systems include:
- Property-based testing for exhaustive scenario coverage
- Chaos engineering for resilience verification
- Model checking for formal verification
- Simulation testing for complex interactions

Key frameworks:
- Jepsen for distributed systems testing
- TLA+ for formal specification
- QuickCheck-style property testing
- Custom simulation environments

## Validation Methodologies

Validation in 2025 emphasizes:
- Contract testing between services
- Behavioral verification using BDD
- Performance validation under load
- Security validation through penetration testing

Methodologies include:
- Test-driven development (TDD) for components
- Behavior-driven development (BDD) for features
- Domain-driven design (DDD) for validation rules
- Continuous validation in CI/CD pipelines

## Quality Assurance Patterns

Modern QA patterns for distributed systems:
- Observability-driven development
- Distributed tracing for debugging
- Synthetic monitoring for proactive detection
- A/B testing for production validation

Best practices:
- Shift-left testing strategies
- Production-like test environments
- Automated regression suites
- Performance benchmarking
