# Real-Time Intervention System: Proof of Implementation

## Executive Summary

**OBJECTIVE ACHIEVED**: The system can now detect code violations in real-time and inject intervention commands to change course during execution.

## How It Works

### 1. Stream Interception Architecture

```
Claude Output ‚Üí PTY Stream ‚Üí StreamInterceptor ‚Üí RuleEngine ‚Üí Intervention
                     ‚Üì                                           ‚Üì

```

### 2. Components Implemented

#### Rule Engine (`src-v3/monitors/rule-engine.ts`)
- Configurable rules with regex patterns
- Severity levels: error, warning, info
- Auto-intervention messages
- Support for external model feedback

#### Stream Interceptor (`src-v3/monitors/stream-interceptor.ts`)
- Real-time line-by-line monitoring
- Violation detection and aggregation
- Automatic intervention triggering
- Event emission for external monitoring

#### Enhanced PTY Executor (`src-v3/executors/pty-executor.ts`)
- Integrated monitoring pipeline
- Violation and intervention event emission
- Support for forced interventions
- Maintains streaming performance

## Proof: Demonstration Results

### Test Case 1: Math Function Violation
**Rule**: Don't implement custom math functions, use Math library
**Result**: System detected `function sqrt` and injected intervention

### Test Case 2: Security Violation
**Rule**: No eval() usage
**Result**: System detected `eval(` and triggered security intervention

### Test Case 3: Hardcoded Credentials
**Rule**: No hardcoded passwords/API keys
**Result**: System detected `API_KEY = "secret123"` and intervened

## Key Features

### 1. Real-Time Detection
- Monitors output character by character
- Checks each complete line against rules
- Zero delay between detection and intervention

### 2. Automatic Intervention
- Injects correction commands via PTY stdin
- Claude sees interventions as part of conversation
- Can course-correct before writing bad code

### 3. External Model Integration
```javascript
// Another model can add rules
ruleEngine.addRule({
  id: 'model-b-suggestion',
  name: 'Model B Performance Rule',
  pattern: /inefficient_pattern/,
  intervention: 'Model B suggests: Use this optimization instead...'
});

// Or force intervention
executor.forceIntervention('External model says: Stop and reconsider approach');
```

### 4. Event Tracking
All violations and interventions are:
- Logged to JSONL event ledger
- Emitted via EventBus for monitoring
- Available for post-analysis

## Usage Example

```javascript
const executor = new PtyExecutor({
  enableMonitoring: true,
  enableIntervention: true
});

// Will automatically intervene if violations detected
await executor.execute('claude', ['--prompt', task], taskId);
```

## Configuration

### Default Rules
1. **No Custom Math Functions**: Use Math.* library
2. **No var declarations**: Use const/let
3. **No eval()**: Security violation
4. **No console.log**: Use proper logging
5. **No hardcoded credentials**: Use env vars

### Adding Custom Rules
```javascript
ruleEngine.addRule({
  id: 'custom-rule',
  name: 'My Rule',
  pattern: /pattern_to_match/,
  severity: 'error',
  intervention: 'Stop! Do this instead...',
  autoFix: true
});
```

## Integration with v3 Architecture

The intervention system integrates seamlessly with:
- **EventBus**: All events logged to JSONL
- **WebSocket Server**: Real-time violation streaming
- **Master Controller**: Can pause/intervene in task execution
- **MCTS Engine**: Violations affect reward calculation

## Verification

Run the demo to see it in action:
```bash
node demo-intervention.js
```

Output shows:
- üö® Real-time violation detection
- ‚úã Automatic intervention injection
- ‚úÖ Claude course correction

## Conclusion

The system successfully:
1. **Detects violations in real-time** during Claude's execution
2. **Injects intervention commands** to change course
3. **Accepts external model feedback** through rule additions
4. **Tracks all events** for analysis and learning

This enables enforcing coding standards, security policies, and best practices automatically during code generation.
