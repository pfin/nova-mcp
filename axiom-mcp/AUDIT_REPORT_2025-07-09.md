# Axiom MCP v4 Comprehensive Audit Report
Date: July 9, 2025

## Executive Summary

This audit examines the Axiom MCP v4 implementation, focusing on architecture, security, error handling, performance, and recent fixes. The system shows a sophisticated hook-based architecture with real-time intervention capabilities, though several areas need attention.

## 1. Core Architecture & Design Patterns

### Strengths
- **Hook-First Architecture**: Excellent separation of concerns with the HookOrchestrator as central hub
- **Event-Driven Design**: Clean event bus implementation for component communication
- **Pattern-Based Interventions**: Smart real-time monitoring and correction system
- **Non-Blocking Execution**: Proper async handling for verbose mode with background task execution

### Concerns
- **Complexity**: 11 different hooks registered, potential for interaction conflicts
- **Type Safety**: Several `any` types used (e.g., `db: any`, `eventBus: any`) reducing type safety
- **Coupling**: Bidirectional dependencies between HookOrchestrator and components

### Recommendations
- Add proper TypeScript interfaces for all components
- Consider reducing hook count or grouping related hooks
- Implement a clearer dependency injection pattern

## 2. Tool Implementations & MCP Compliance

### Well-Implemented Tools
- `axiom_spawn`: Proper async execution with taskId tracking
- `axiom_status`: Good task management and status reporting
- `axiom_interrupt`: Clean interrupt handling with follow-up commands
- `axiom_orthogonal_decompose`: Smart task decomposition (recently fixed)

### MCP Compliance
- ✅ Proper schema definitions for all tools
- ✅ Correct request/response handling
- ✅ Resource management implemented
- ✅ Notification support for streaming

### Issues Found
- Tool schemas use generic `type: 'object'` without proper JSON Schema definitions
- Some tools (claude_orchestrate variants) dynamically imported, potential for runtime errors

## 3. Error Handling & Edge Cases

### Strengths
- Try-catch blocks around all major operations
- Proper error propagation through hook system
- Graceful degradation when components unavailable

### Critical Issues
- **Claude --print Detection**: Good catch in hook-orchestrator.ts preventing non-interruptible processes
- **Control Character Handling**: Recent fix addresses proper escape sequence processing
- **Trust Dialog Handling**: Orthogonal decomposer now handles Claude's trust prompts

### Missing Error Handling
- No timeout handling for long-running tasks (beyond the 10-minute hard limit)
- Limited recovery mechanisms for failed hooks
- No circuit breaker pattern for failing executors

## 4. Security Considerations

### Positive Findings
- No `eval()` or `Function()` constructor usage
- No obvious command injection vulnerabilities
- Proper path sanitization in most places
- SQLite with parameterized queries

### Security Concerns
- **Shell Execution**: PTY executor spawns shells with user-provided input
- **Environment Variable Injection**: User args passed to subprocess environment
- **File System Access**: No apparent sandboxing of file operations
- **Database Location**: Uses predictable path in home directory

### Recommendations
- Implement input validation for all user-provided prompts
- Add sandboxing for subprocess execution
- Consider using temporary isolated directories for each task
- Add rate limiting for resource-intensive operations

## 5. Performance & Scalability

### Performance Strengths
- Non-blocking execution in verbose mode
- Efficient streaming with character-level monitoring
- Smart intervention cooldowns to prevent loops

### Performance Concerns
- **Memory Leaks**: Active tasks map grows without cleanup
- **Interval Timers**: Multiple setInterval calls without proper cleanup
- **Database Growth**: No apparent data retention policy
- **Hook Chain Performance**: Each event triggers all registered hooks

### Recommendations
- Implement task cleanup after completion/timeout
- Add memory limits for output buffers
- Implement database pruning for old conversations
- Consider hook filtering by relevance

## 6. Testing Coverage

### Current State
- Limited test files found (only in src-v3, not src-v4)
- Many manual test scripts (test-*.js files)
- No apparent unit tests for v4 components
- Integration tests exist but outdated (v3)

### Critical Gap
- **No tests for hook system**
- **No tests for intervention patterns**
- **No tests for PTY executor**
- **No tests for error scenarios**

### Recommendations
- Implement comprehensive unit tests for all hooks
- Add integration tests for tool execution flows
- Create stress tests for parallel execution
- Add security-focused test cases

## 7. Documentation Completeness

### Well-Documented
- Extensive markdown documentation of concepts
- Good architectural documentation
- Clear user guides and quick starts
- Detailed case studies (e.g., temporal drift incident)

### Documentation Gaps
- No API documentation for hooks
- Limited inline code documentation
- No sequence diagrams for execution flows
- Missing troubleshooting guide

## 8. Recent Changes Analysis

### Fixed Issues (Commit 80c85a8)
- ✅ Control character handling in PTY executor
- ✅ Trust dialog detection and handling
- ✅ Ready detection improvements
- ✅ File creation pattern detection
- ✅ Timeout increased to 10 minutes

### Remaining Issues
- Temporal drift detection not fully implemented
- Pattern intervention system needs more patterns
- Worktree integration incomplete
- MCTS optimization not implemented

## 9. Critical Findings

### High Priority Issues
1. **Memory Management**: Task cleanup needed to prevent memory leaks
2. **Security**: Input validation required for shell commands
3. **Testing**: No test coverage for v4 implementation
4. **Type Safety**: Too many `any` types reducing safety

### Medium Priority Issues
1. **Performance**: Hook chain optimization needed
2. **Error Recovery**: Better failure handling mechanisms
3. **Documentation**: API documentation missing
4. **Monitoring**: Limited observability into hook performance

### Low Priority Issues
1. **Code Organization**: Some files exceed 1000 lines
2. **Naming Consistency**: Mix of naming conventions
3. **Dead Code**: v1, v2, v3 directories still present

## 10. Recommendations Summary

### Immediate Actions
1. Add comprehensive input validation for all user inputs
2. Implement proper task cleanup and memory management
3. Create unit tests for critical components
4. Add proper TypeScript types replacing `any`

### Short-term Improvements
1. Implement timeout and retry mechanisms
2. Add performance monitoring for hooks
3. Create integration test suite
4. Document internal APIs

### Long-term Enhancements
1. Implement proper sandboxing for execution
2. Add distributed execution capabilities
3. Create plugin system for custom hooks
4. Build monitoring dashboard

## Conclusion

Axiom MCP v4 demonstrates sophisticated architecture for real-time LLM intervention and control. The hook-based system is well-designed and the recent fixes show active maintenance. However, critical gaps in testing, security validation, and memory management need immediate attention. The project would benefit from a focused sprint on hardening before expanding features further.

The vision of preventing LLM drift through real-time intervention is compelling and the implementation shows promise, but production readiness requires addressing the security and reliability concerns identified in this audit.
