# Axiom MCP v3: From Vision to Reality

## Executive Summary

Axiom MCP v3 represents a paradigm shift from "AI that plans" to "AI that does" through parallel execution, real-time observation, and intelligent intervention.

## What We Discovered

### The Core Problem
- Current v3 has all the pieces (PTY executor, MCTS, rules) but they're not connected
- Tools decompose tasks but don't execute implementations
- The system operates in eternal "research mode"

### The Key Insight
Instead of trying to plan the perfect approach upfront, we should:
1. **Launch multiple attempts in parallel**
2. **Observe their output in real-time**
3. **Intervene when they go off track**
4. **Amplify what's working**
5. **Merge the best results**

## The Solution Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Observable Execution Streams**
   - Character-by-character output capture
   - Pattern detection in real-time
   - Cross-stream correlation

2. **Rule-Based Intervention System**
   - Detect anti-patterns (TODO, research loops)
   - Inject corrections immediately
   - Learn from intervention effectiveness

3. **Parallel Experimentation via Git Worktrees**
   - Isolated environments for each approach
   - No contamination between attempts
   - Easy comparison and merging

4. **MCTS-Driven Resource Allocation**
   - Score streams based on progress
   - Allocate more resources to winners
   - Kill failing approaches early

5. **Success Amplification**
   - Extract patterns from working solutions
   - Broadcast to other streams
   - Build reusable pattern library

## Revolutionary Use Cases

### 1. Competitive Implementation Racing
Multiple approaches compete to implement the same feature. First to pass all tests wins, but best practices from all attempts get merged.

### 2. Bug Hunt Swarms
10+ parallel attempts attack the same bug from different angles. When one finds the fix, all others verify and enhance it.

### 3. Architecture Evolution Chamber
Test different architectural approaches in parallel universes. Measure real performance, not theoretical benefits.

### 4. Self-Improving System
The system learns which interventions work, which patterns succeed, and continuously improves its effectiveness.

## Implementation Strategy

### Immediate Fixes (This Week)
1. Connect PTY executor to axiom_mcp_spawn tool
2. Add file change verification
3. Implement basic "no TODO" rule

### Quick Wins (Next 2 Weeks)
1. Stream observation dashboard
2. Pattern detection system
3. Basic intervention engine

### Game Changers (Month 2)
1. Parallel worktree orchestration
2. MCTS resource optimization
3. Success pattern amplification

## Why This Matters

### Traditional Development
- Linear: Try → Fail → Try Again
- Slow: One approach at a time
- Risky: All eggs in one basket
- Limited: Human bandwidth constrains

### Axiom v3 Development
- Parallel: Try many approaches simultaneously
- Fast: Best solution emerges quickly
- Reliable: Multiple paths to success
- Scalable: Add more streams for complex problems

## Concrete Next Steps

### 1. Fix the Core Issue
```typescript
// Change this:
const result = await executeWithClaude(prompt);

// To this:
const result = await executeWithPTY(prompt);
```

### 2. Add Basic Observation
```typescript
ptyProcess.on('data', (chunk) => {
  detectPatterns(chunk);
  emitToStream(chunk);
});
```

### 3. Implement First Rule
```typescript
if (output.includes('TODO')) {
  ptyProcess.write('# Implement the TODO now\n');
}
```

### 4. Create Simple Dashboard
```html
<div id="streams">
  <div class="stream" data-id="1">
    <pre class="output"></pre>
  </div>
</div>
```

## The Philosophy

**"Don't plan for perfection. Execute in parallel, observe carefully, intervene intelligently, and synthesize success."**

## Key Design Principles

1. **Execution Over Planning**: Real code > perfect plans
2. **Parallel Over Serial**: Many attempts > one attempt
3. **Observation Over Hope**: Watch what happens > assume it works
4. **Intervention Over Failure**: Fix problems immediately > let them compound
5. **Synthesis Over Selection**: Combine best parts > pick single winner

## Success Metrics

- **Before**: 60% of tasks produce only research
- **After Goal**: 95% produce working code
- **Speed**: 10x faster to working solution
- **Quality**: Higher through parallel refinement
- **Learning**: System improves continuously

## The Revolution

Axiom v3 transforms AI-assisted development from a linear, hopeful process into a parallel, observable, controllable system. It's not just an improvement - it's a fundamental reimagining of how AI can help us build software.

Instead of an AI assistant that might help, we get an AI laboratory that guarantees results through parallel experimentation and intelligent intervention.

## Call to Action

1. **Today**: Fix the core execution issue
2. **This Week**: Add observation and basic rules
3. **This Month**: Implement parallel execution
4. **This Quarter**: Build the full vision

The future of AI-assisted development isn't better planning - it's massive parallelism with intelligent observation and intervention. Let's build it.
