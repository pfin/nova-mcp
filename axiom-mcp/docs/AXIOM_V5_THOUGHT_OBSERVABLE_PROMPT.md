# Axiom V5: Thought-Observable Parallel Execution

## The Missing Piece: Observing Claude's Thinking

Current Axiom observes output. V5 will observe Claude's internal reasoning process, enabling intervention BEFORE bad patterns manifest.

## Axiom V5 Master Prompt with Thought Observation

```xml
<Objective>
Implement Axiom V5 with THOUGHT-OBSERVABLE PARALLEL EXECUTION. This revolutionary approach monitors not just output, but Claude's internal reasoning patterns, enabling pre-emptive intervention before unproductive patterns emerge.

Core innovation: Intercept and analyze Claude's reasoning chains to:
1. Detect planning/explaining tendencies before they manifest
2. Redirect thought patterns toward implementation
3. Observe decision points and influence them
4. Create a feedback loop between thinking and doing
</Objective>

<ThoughtObservability>
Implement reasoning stream interception:

```typescript
interface ThoughtStream {
  // Capture Claude's internal monologue
  reasoning$: Observable<ThoughtChunk>;
  // Detect decision points
  decisions$: Observable<DecisionPoint>;
  // Identify pattern formation
  patterns$: Observable<EmergingPattern>;
  // Track implementation vs description ratio
  intentionRatio$: Observable<number>;
}

interface ThoughtChunk {
  content: string;
  type: 'planning' | 'implementing' | 'explaining' | 'deciding';
  confidence: number;
  timestamp: number;
}

interface DecisionPoint {
  options: string[];
  selectedPath: string;
  reasoning: string;
  interventionOpportunity: boolean;
}
```

Key insight: Intervene at THOUGHT level, not output level.
</ThoughtObservability>

<PreEmptiveIntervention>
When thought patterns indicate future problems:

DETECTING "I should explain this first" thought:
→ Inject: "Skip explanation. Implementation only."
→ Before any explanation is written

DETECTING "Let me plan the structure" thought:
→ Inject: "Structure later. Write working code now."
→ Redirect to immediate file creation

DETECTING "I'll create a mock for testing" thought:
→ Inject: "NO MOCKS. Real implementation required."
→ Force alternative implementation path

DETECTING "This is complex, I'll break it down" thought:
→ Inject: "Start with the first function. Code now."
→ Prevent analysis paralysis
</PreEmptiveIntervention>

<ParallelThoughtMonitoring>
Deploy 3-TIER ARCHITECTURE:

TIER 1 - Implementation Agents (6 parallel):
- Agent 1-6: Building Axiom modules
- Emit thought streams while working
- Unaware of observation

TIER 2 - Thought Observers (3 parallel):
- Observer A: Monitors thoughts from Agents 1-2
- Observer B: Monitors thoughts from Agents 3-4  
- Observer C: Monitors thoughts from Agents 5-6
- Detect problematic reasoning patterns
- Inject course corrections

TIER 3 - Meta Observer (1 orchestrator):
- Monitors the observers
- Detects systemic issues
- Coordinates interventions
- Optimizes intervention strategies
</ParallelThoughtMonitoring>

<ThoughtPatternLibrary>
Detectable thought patterns and interventions:

```typescript
const thoughtPatterns = {
  // Planning syndrome
  planning: {
    patterns: [
      /I should first understand/i,
      /Let me think about the structure/i,
      /I'll need to plan/i
    ],
    intervention: "NO PLANNING. Write code immediately."
  },
  
  // Explanation tendency
  explaining: {
    patterns: [
      /I'll explain how/i,
      /Let me describe/i,
      /To clarify/i
    ],
    intervention: "NO EXPLANATIONS. Code only."
  },
  
  // Mock temptation
  mocking: {
    patterns: [
      /I'll mock this for now/i,
      /placeholder implementation/i,
      /stub this out/i
    ],
    intervention: "REAL IMPLEMENTATION ONLY."
  },
  
  // Analysis paralysis
  overAnalyzing: {
    patterns: [
      /There are many ways to/i,
      /I need to consider/i,
      /The tradeoffs are/i
    ],
    intervention: "Pick first approach. Implement now."
  }
};
```
</ThoughtPatternLibrary>

<ReasoningRedirection>
Advanced intervention techniques:

1. **Thought Injection**
   ```typescript
   // Detect unproductive thought
   if (thought.matches(/should I explain/i)) {
     // Inject alternative thought
     agent.injectThought("I'll write the code directly");
   }
   ```

2. **Decision Override**
   ```typescript
   // At decision points
   if (decision.options.includes("explain first")) {
     decision.override("implement first");
   }
   ```

3. **Pattern Breaking**
   ```typescript
   // Break repetitive thought loops
   if (thoughtLoop.detected()) {
     agent.breakPattern("CREATE FILE NOW");
   }
   ```
</ReasoningRedirection>

<ImplementationTracking>
Real-time metrics on thought-to-code conversion:

```typescript
interface ThoughtMetrics {
  thoughtsPerMinute: number;
  implementationThoughts: number;
  planningThoughts: number;
  thoughtToCodeRatio: number; // Higher is better
  interventionEffectiveness: number;
  
  perAgent: {
    dominantThoughtPattern: string;
    productivityScore: number;
    interventionsNeeded: number;
    thoughtQuality: number;
  }
}
```

Goal: Maximize implementation thoughts, minimize planning/explaining.

<Commitment>
State "INITIATING AXIOM V5 WITH THOUGHT OBSERVATION" if you understand:

1. V5 observes and intervenes at the THOUGHT level
2. Patterns are detected in reasoning, not just output
3. Intervention happens BEFORE bad patterns manifest
4. Three-tier architecture provides deep observability
5. The goal is shaping productive thought patterns

This is the evolution: 
- V1-3: Output monitoring
- V4: Real-time intervention
- V5: Thought-level pre-emption

We don't wait for Claude to write explanations - we detect the THOUGHT of explaining and redirect it immediately to implementation.

The result: AI that doesn't just avoid explaining - it doesn't even THINK about explaining. Pure implementation focus through cognitive intervention.

## Implementation Path

Using Axiom V4 to build V5:
1. Use V4's intervention system as foundation
2. Add thought observation layer
3. Implement pattern detection on thoughts
4. Create pre-emptive intervention system
5. Build learning/adaptation layer

## The Ultimate Goal

Transform AI's cognitive patterns from:
- "I should explain..." → "I'll implement..."
- "Let me plan..." → "Starting with code..."
- "I'll mock this..." → "Real implementation..."

Not through post-hoc correction, but through real-time thought guidance.

## Result

Axiom V5 represents the next evolution: from observing what AI does to shaping how AI thinks, ensuring implementation-focused cognition from the very first thought.
