# Research Findings Summary

## Key Discoveries

### 1. **Permission Bypass Works**
- `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p "prompt"` successfully creates files
- This flag bypasses the permission check that was blocking execution
- Files are actually created when using this flag

### 2. **Interactive Mode Issues**
- `claude` (without -p) spawns but doesn't respond to stdin in subprocess
- Even with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, interactive mode doesn't communicate
- This appears to be a fundamental limitation of Claude Code in subprocess environments

### 3. **Working Approach**
```javascript
// This works:
execSync('claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p "Create file with Write tool"', {
  encoding: 'utf-8',
  stdio: ['inherit', 'pipe', 'pipe'],
  timeout: 15000
});
```

### 4. **Root Causes Identified**
From GitHub issues research:
- Claude Code has known subprocess issues in Node.js (works in Python)
- 1000ms default timeout is too short
- Non-terminating processes cause hanging
- TTY detection affects behavior

### 5. **What Doesn't Work**
- Interactive mode (`claude` without -p) - no response to stdin
- Regular `claude -p` without permission flag - asks for permission
- Various stdio configurations don't fix interactive mode
- Shell mode, detached processes - same issues

## Implementation Status

### Built and Ready:
1. **Interactive Controller** - Architecture complete, would work if subprocess responded
2. **Verbose Mode** - Detailed logging and real-time observation
3. **System Verification** - Cannot be fooled by claims
4. **Adaptive Prompting** - Logic for follow-up based on state

### Needs Fixing:
1. **Subprocess Communication** - Interactive mode doesn't work
2. **Alternative Approach** - Use `claude -p` with retries instead

## Recommended Solution

Since interactive mode doesn't work in subprocess, modify the implementation to:

1. **Use `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p`** for each interaction
2. **Implement retry logic** with verification between attempts
3. **Build prompts dynamically** based on previous output
4. **Maintain context** across multiple subprocess calls

Example approach:
```javascript
async function interactiveImplementation(task) {
  let attempts = 0;
  let context = '';
  
  while (attempts < maxAttempts) {
    const prompt = buildPrompt(task, context, verification);
    
    const output = execSync(
      `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p "${prompt}"`,
      { stdio: ['inherit', 'pipe', 'pipe'] }
    );
    
    context += output;
    const proof = verification.gatherProof();
    
    if (proof.hasImplementation && proof.testsPass) {
      return { success: true, attempts };
    }
    
    attempts++;
  }
  
  return { success: false, attempts };
}
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Research Before Building** - The subprocess issue could have been discovered earlier
2. **Test Core Assumptions** - Interactive mode was assumed to work
3. **Read Error Codes** - Exit code 143 indicates timeout/SIGTERM
4. **Check Documentation** - The `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag was key
5. **GitHub Issues Are Gold** - Similar issues were already reported

## Next Steps

1. Implement the working approach using sequential `claude -p` calls
2. Add proper context management between calls
3. Use system verification to guide prompts
4. Test with real implementation tasks
5. Consider using Claude API instead of CLI for reliability
