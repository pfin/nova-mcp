# Axiom MCP v3 Use Case Guide: Practical Examples

## Use Case 1: Building a Real-time Chat Application

### Traditional Approach (Single Thread)
```
1. Research WebSocket libraries
2. Plan architecture
3. Implement server
4. Implement client
5. Add authentication
6. Test
7. Fix bugs
8. Deploy
Time: 4-6 hours
Success Rate: 60%
```

### Axiom v3 Approach (Parallel Experimentation)
```
Parallel Streams:
├── Stream A: Socket.io approach
├── Stream B: Native WebSocket approach  
├── Stream C: Server-Sent Events approach
└── Stream D: WebRTC data channels

Real-time Observations:
- A: Quick setup, but heavy dependencies [Score: 75]
- B: Lightweight, but more boilerplate [Score: 82]
- C: Simple, but no bi-directional [Score: 45]
- D: Overkill for chat [STOPPED at 5 min]

Rule Interventions:
- [10:05] Stream C: "SSE is unidirectional" → STOP
- [10:08] Stream A: "TODO: add auth" → "Implement auth NOW"
- [10:12] Stream B: "Connection working!" → "Good! Add message history"

Final Result:
- Merge B's lightweight core with A's auth approach
- Time: 45 minutes
- Success Rate: 95%
```

## Use Case 2: Debugging Production Crisis

### Scenario
"Users report intermittent 500 errors on checkout"

### Parallel Investigation Streams
```
Stream 1: Database Query Analysis
├── Monitor slow queries
├── Check connection pool
└── Analyze lock contention

Stream 2: Memory Profiling
├── Heap dump analysis
├── GC pattern monitoring
└── Memory leak detection

Stream 3: Network Layer
├── Load balancer logs
├── Timeout patterns
└── Retry storms

Stream 4: Application Logic
├── Race conditions
├── Cache invalidation
└── State management
```

### Real-time Pattern Detection
```
[00:30] Pattern: All errors happen at :15 and :45
[00:32] Stream 3: "Seeing cache purge at :15" [AMPLIFY]
[00:33] Cross-reference: Streams 1,2,4 show spikes at :15
[00:35] Intervention: "Focus all streams on cache behavior"
[00:38] Solution: Cache stampede during scheduled purge
[00:40] Fix deployed to all streams for verification
```

## Use Case 3: API Client Library Generation

### Goal
"Generate Python, JavaScript, and Go clients for our API"

### Parallel Generation Strategy
```
Worktree Layout:
main/
├── python-client/
│   ├── approach-1-codegen/    (OpenAPI → Code)
│   ├── approach-2-requests/   (Handwritten + Requests)
│   └── approach-3-httpx/      (Async with HTTPX)
├── javascript-client/
│   ├── approach-1-fetch/      (Native Fetch)
│   ├── approach-2-axios/      (Axios-based)
│   └── approach-3-codegen/    (OpenAPI Generator)
└── go-client/
    ├── approach-1-stdlib/     (Net/http only)
    ├── approach-2-resty/      (Go-resty)
    └── approach-3-codegen/    (OpenAPI Generator)
```

### Cross-Language Pattern Sharing
```
[Discovery] Python approach-3 handles auth elegantly
[Propagate] Share auth pattern to JS and Go streams
[Verify] All languages implement consistent auth
[Merge] Best practices from each language
```

## Use Case 4: Database Migration Strategy

### Challenge
"Migrate 10TB PostgreSQL to distributed architecture"

### Parallel Migration Experiments
```
Stream A: Sharding Approach
- Shard by customer_id
- Test query performance  
- Measure complexity

Stream B: Read Replicas + Cache
- PostgreSQL replicas
- Redis cache layer
- Eventual consistency

Stream C: Full NoSQL Migration
- DynamoDB modeling
- Data transformation
- Cost analysis

Stream D: Hybrid Solution
- Critical data in PostgreSQL
- Analytics in Clickhouse
- Cache in Redis
```

### Real-time Decisions
```
[Hour 1] Stream C: DynamoDB costs 10x higher → REDUCE RESOURCES
[Hour 2] Stream A: Sharding works, but complex → CONTINUE
[Hour 3] Stream D: Best performance/cost → AMPLIFY
[Hour 4] Merge: Use D's architecture with A's sharding strategy
```

## Use Case 5: Performance Optimization Challenge

### Task
"Make this data processing pipeline 10x faster"

### Parallel Optimization Tracks
```
Algorithmic (Stream 1-3):

└── Stream 3: Dynamic programming approach

System-Level (Stream 4-6):
├── Stream 4: Multi-threading
├── Stream 5: GPU acceleration  
└── Stream 6: Memory-mapped files

Infrastructure (Stream 7-9):
├── Stream 7: Distributed processing
├── Stream 8: Better hardware
└── Stream 9: Caching layer
```

### MCTS-Guided Resource Allocation
```
Initial: Equal resources to all 9 streams
10 min: Stream 1 showing 3x improvement → +2 workers
20 min: Stream 5 GPU achieving 8x → +3 workers  
30 min: Stream 1 + 5 combination testing → +4 workers
40 min: 12x improvement achieved!
```

Action: "Implement it now, not later"
Result: 90% reduction in technical debt
```

### 2. The "Show Me" Rule
```
Trigger: "I would implement..." or "You could..."
Action: "Show me the actual code"
Result: 85% more working implementations
```

### 3. The "Test First" Rule
```
Trigger: Implementation without test
Action: "Write the test before proceeding"
Result: 95% better code coverage
```

### 4. The "Timeout" Rule
```
Trigger: Same operation > 30 seconds
Action: "Try a different approach"
Result: 70% faster completion
```

### 5. The "Celebrate Success" Rule
```
Trigger: Test passes or feature works
Action: "Excellent! Now do similar for X"
Result: 80% momentum maintenance
```

## The Power of Parallel Thinking

Traditional development is linear: try, fail, try again. Axiom v3 makes development parallel: try many approaches, learn fast, combine winners. It's not just faster—it's fundamentally more likely to succeed.
