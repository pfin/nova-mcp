# Axiom MCP v3 Implementation Learnings

## Key Learnings from Testing

### 1. The Implementation Gap

**Problem**: When using Axiom MCP to fix its own issues, it spawned tasks but produced empty outputs.

**Root Cause**: The system is still in "research mode" - it decomposes tasks but doesn't execute implementations.

**Evidence**: 
- Task IDs show as completed but outputs are empty
- No actual code changes were made
- No commits were created by the tool itself

### 2. MCP Inspector Connection

**Problem**: Inspector times out waiting for connection.

**Solution**: Created a minimal test script that successfully connects:
```typescript
// Simple server that works with inspector
const server = new Server({
  name: 'axiom-mcp-test',
  version: '0.1.0'
}, {
  capabilities: { tools: {} }
});
```

**Key Finding**: The issue isn't with the transport mechanism but with how v3 initializes.

### 3. Prompt Configuration Not Enforcing Implementation

**Problem**: Despite having implementation-focused prompts, the system still only researches.

**Evidence**: The prompt config exists but isn't being used effectively by the PTY executor.

### 4. Event System Working but Not Connected

**Problem**: Event bus initializes but doesn't capture actual execution.

**Evidence**: 
- Logs show "Event bus initialized"
- Tasks start but no execution events
- No intervention rules trigger

## Required Fixes

1. **Connect PTY Executor to MCP Tools**
   - Currently tools spawn tasks but don't use PTY executor
   - Need to wire handleAxiomMcpSpawn to use PTYExecutor

2. **Implement Intervention Rules**
   - Rules are defined but not enforced
   - Need to inject interventions into execution stream

3. **Fix Tool Registration**
   - Tools are imported but may not be properly registered
   - Test with simple tool first, then add complex ones

4. **Add Execution Verification**
   - Check if code was actually written
   - Verify files were created/modified
   - Ensure commits happen

## Testing Strategy

1. Start with minimal working server (test-inspector.ts)
2. Add one tool at a time
3. Verify each tool actually executes code
4. Test with inspector after each addition
5. Commit working increments

## Next Steps

1. Fix tool registration in index.ts
2. Wire PTY executor to spawn tool
3. Add execution verification
4. Test with real implementation task
5. Document what actually works vs claims
