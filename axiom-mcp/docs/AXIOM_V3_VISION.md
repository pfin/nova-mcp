# Axiom MCP v3 Vision: Real-time Observation, Intervention & Parallel Experimentation

## Core Concept: Observe, Intervene, Learn, Adapt

Instead of just planning tasks, Axiom v3 observes multiple parallel executions in real-time, applies rules to streaming output, and uses MCTS to dynamically adjust execution paths based on what's working.

### Key Capabilities

1. **Character-by-Character Analysis**: Watch output as it streams, detect patterns early
2. **Cross-Stream Pattern Detection**: Notice when multiple children hit similar issues
3. **Early Intervention**: Stop/redirect execution before wasting time
4. **Success Pattern Learning**: Identify what's working and amplify it

## 🎯 Rule-Based Intervention System

### Rule Categories

1. **Anti-Pattern Detection**
   - "Detected 'TODO' in output → Intervene with 'Implement now, not TODO'"
   - "Detected research loop → Force implementation command"
   - "Detected placeholder code → Demand working implementation"

2. **Progress Monitoring**
   - "No file changes in 30 seconds → Ask 'What specific file are you editing?'"
   - "Same error 3 times → Suggest different approach"
   - "Circular imports detected → Stop and restructure"

3. **Quality Gates**
   - "Test command failed → Cannot proceed until fixed"
   - "Linter errors → Fix before continuing"
   - "Security vulnerability → Immediate halt and fix"

4. **Success Amplification**
   - "Working test created → Create more similar tests"
   - "Clean code pattern → Apply to other files"
   - "Performance improvement → Document and propagate"

## 🌳 Git Worktree Parallel Experimentation

### Concept: Multiple Realities
```
main-branch/
├── worktree-approach-1/  (Try functional approach)
├── worktree-approach-2/  (Try OOP approach)
├── worktree-approach-3/  (Try hybrid approach)
└── worktree-approach-4/  (Try microservices)
```

Each worktree runs the same task with different approaches, allowing:
- Real parallel experimentation (not sequential)
- No contamination between attempts
- Easy comparison of results
- Cherry-pick best solutions

## 🧠 MCTS Applied to Live Execution

### Dynamic Path Selection
Instead of planning entire trees upfront, MCTS guides ongoing execution:

1. **Initial Paths**: Start 4 parallel attempts with different strategies
2. **Score Streaming Output**: Rate progress every 10 seconds
3. **Exploit Success**: Allocate more resources to promising paths
4. **Explore Alternatives**: Keep trying new approaches on failing paths
5. **Merge Best Results**: Combine successful elements from all paths

### Scoring Metrics
- Lines of working code written
- Tests passing
- Files successfully created
- Errors resolved
- Time to first working output
