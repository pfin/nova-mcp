  spawnPattern: "decompose",
  spawnCount: 1 
})

# Verify:
- [ ] TODO detected in stream
- [ ] Intervention triggered
- [ ] Violation recorded in database
```

### SDK Executor ↔ Task Router
```bash
# Test: Non-interactive task
axiom_mcp_spawn({

  spawnPattern: "decompose",
  spawnCount: 2 
})

# Verify:
- [ ] SDK executor selected (not PTY)

- [ ] Some may fail (OK)
- [ ] Best approach identifiable
- [ ] Can merge solutions

ORDER BY started_at DESC;

-- Check interventions
SELECT * FROM actions 
WHERE type = 'intervention' 
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;

-- Check file creation
SELECT * FROM actions 
WHERE type = 'file_created' 
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

### Stream Replay
**Not yet implemented but should verify**:
- [ ] Can replay any execution
- [ ] Timestamps accurate
- [ ] Events in correct order
- [ ] Interventions visible

## Success Metrics

### Execution Success
- [ ] 80%+ tasks create files
- [ ] 90%+ interventions improve output
- [ ] 95%+ tasks complete without crashes
- [ ] 100% outputs captured

### Performance Targets
- [ ] <30s for simple tasks
- [ ] <2min for complex tasks
- [ ] <100ms intervention latency
- [ ] <1s child startup time

- [ ] 0 TODOs in final code
- [ ] 100% files verified to exist
- [ ] 90%+ code runs successfully
- [ ] 80%+ tests pass (when created)

## Conclusion

This checklist reveals that while core execution works, critical gaps remain in:
1. Child output visibility
2. Stream aggregation
3. Parallel execution
4. MCTS integration
5. Inter-agent communication

**Current System Score**: 35/100 checkboxes ✓ (35%)

The path forward is clear: implement stream aggregation and verbose master mode to unlock the system's true potential.
