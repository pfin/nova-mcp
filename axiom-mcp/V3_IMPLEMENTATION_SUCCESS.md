# Axiom MCP v3: Implementation Success Report

## Executive Summary

**SUCCESS**: Axiom MCP v3 now generates actual implementation code instead of just research!

## What We Fixed

### 1. Task-Aware Prompt System
- Modified `getCompleteSystemPrompt()` to detect implementation tasks
- For implementation tasks, uses ONLY the implementation prompt without research framing
- Research tasks still get the full research-oriented prompts

### 2. MCTS Parameter Tuning
- Changed exploration constant from √2 (1.414) to 0.5 for more exploitation
- This makes the system favor proven implementation approaches over exploration

### 3. SystemVerification Integration
- Connected SystemVerification to MCTS reward calculation
- Rewards based on actual filesystem artifacts (unhackable proof):
  - 40% for having implementation files
  - 20% for having test files  
  - 30% for tests passing
  - 10% for security and quality

### 4. Meta-Cognitive Scoring
- Integrated BEFORE/AFTER/HOW compliance into rewards
- Tasks that follow the meta-cognitive pattern score higher
- Multiplier ranges from 0.8x to 1.0x based on compliance

## Test Results

### Calculator Implementation Test
```
✅ calculator.py created with working code
✅ test_calculator.py created with comprehensive tests
✅ Tests pass when run with Python
✅ No "would implement" or "should create" language
```

### Generated Code Quality
The system generated:
- Complete calculator.py with 6 functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide, power, modulo)
- Proper error handling for division by zero
- Comprehensive test suite with pytest
- Edge case testing
- Exception testing

## Key Insights from Expert Documents

1. **Axiom MCP IS Monte Carlo Tree Search** - not similar to it, it literally implements MCTS
2. **The problem was parametric, not architectural** - it was tuned for exploration (research) not exploitation (implementation)
3. **The fix was simple** - adjust parameters and fix prompt framing

## What's Still Pending

1. **SystemVerification Reporting**: The verification results aren't showing in the output properly
2. **Sidecar Processes**: ConsoleWatcher and CriteriaChecker still need implementation
3. **Judge Agent**: Cross-validation agent for quality assurance

## Conclusion

The core issue has been resolved. Axiom MCP v3 now:
- ✅ Writes actual code files
- ✅ Creates working implementations
- ✅ Generates and runs tests
- ✅ Uses MCTS for intelligent code generation
- ✅ Avoids "research mode" language when doing implementation

The system is successfully generating implementation code using Monte Carlo Tree Search with proper exploitation/exploration balance.
