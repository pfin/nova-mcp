## Modern Event-Driven Hook Patterns

Event-driven architectures have evolved to embrace reactive patterns that allow for fine-grained control over application state and behavior. Modern hooks leverage event emitters, observables, and publish-subscribe patterns to create loosely coupled systems that can react to changes across distributed components.

Key patterns include:
- Lifecycle hooks that tap into component initialization, updates, and destruction
- Middleware hooks for intercepting and transforming data flows
- Async hooks for managing concurrent operations and side effects
- Custom event hooks for domain-specific behaviors

## React Server Components Hooks

React Server Components introduce a new paradigm for hooks that execute on the server, enabling:
- Data fetching hooks that run at request time
- Server-only hooks for sensitive operations
- Streaming hooks for progressive enhancement
- Cache-aware hooks for optimized performance

These hooks blur the line between client and server, allowing developers to write unified code that executes in the optimal environment based on requirements.

## Signals and Fine-Grained Reactivity

Signals represent a return to fine-grained reactivity, offering:
- Automatic dependency tracking without explicit declarations
- Minimal re-renders through precise update targeting
- Composable primitives for building complex reactive systems
- Performance benefits through lazy evaluation and memoization

Modern signal implementations provide hooks for:
- Creating and managing reactive values
- Computing derived state automatically
- Batching updates for optimal performance
- Integrating with existing component models
