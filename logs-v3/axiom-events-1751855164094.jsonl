The successful execution of actual code (rather than just planning) demonstrates the principle of \"execution over planning\" that the v3 vision emphasizes.\r\n\r\nThe output confirms that basic Python execution is working, which is a prerequisite for the larger goal of transforming Axiom from a planning tool into a parallel execution observatory.\r\n\u001b[?25h\u001b[?25h","timestamp":"2025-07-07T08:43:55.569Z"}
